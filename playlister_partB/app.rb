# Your CLI should prompt the user with "Browse by artist or genre".  If they type "artist" and hit enter it should take them to the next section which should print out a list of artists, or genres.  The artist index must list all the artists. This list must be sorted alphabetically.
# In addition to the Artists name, the artists total song count should be displayed.  This list should also say how many Artists there are in total.  Your CLI should prompt the user with "Select Artist"
# When they type in the name of an artist your program should print out a list of songs and genres. For example

# The Genre interface for the CLI should prompt the user with "Select Genre"
# The genre index must list all the genres. This list must be sorted by the amount of songs.
# In addition to the Genres name, the total song and artist count should be listed along side it.

# Folk: 8 Songs, 3 Artists
 
# Once the user types a genre and hits enter they should be taken to the individual genre "page"
 
# The genres page should list the name of the songs, linking to the individual
# \# song and artists. Also include the total unique artists and song counts in the genre.
 
# ####Folk    
# #####1. M83 - Midnight City  
# #####2. Lady Gaga - Pokerface  
 
# So a user should be able to type M83 and be taken to M83's artist "page" or Midnight City and get taken to the songs "page".  The song page should list all the available information on the song, it's artist and genre.
 
# If a user types the artist or genre, they should be taken to the genre or artists "page"/interface
# \# Extra Credit:
# \# Use a ruby module somewhere to refactor common functionality.

# Note: if someone browses by artist, and sees the artist has 4 songs and enters song 4, this is song 4 from the entire list of songs, not just the songs we just displayed for the artist.  This is ok, lets not overcomplicate things.
